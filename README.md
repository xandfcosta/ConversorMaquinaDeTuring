# Turing Machine Converter
Project made to help in an Graph class assignment. Made with [@darkratos](https://github.com/darkratos)

It takes an input.jff file made from JFlap on the root folder and converts it to a output.txt that can be run in [Turing machine simulator](https://turingmachinesimulator.com/)
